Managing containerized applications in the cloud is a critical skill for modern developers and IT professionals. This course provides a comprehensive, hands-on guide to deploying and managing containers using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). You'll learn how to set up the foundational networking, clusters, and load balancing necessary to run production-grade container workloads. The course covers both orchestrated (ECS & EKS) and serverless (Fargate) container deployment, ensuring you can optimize resources while scaling applications efficiently.

Throughout the course, you'll gain real-world, practical experience in setting up ECS clusters, launching tasks and services, and integrating Application Load Balancers (ALB) for traffic distribution. You'll explore EKS Auto Mode, Fargate, and EKS Anywhere, enabling you to deploy Kubernetes workloads across AWS and hybrid environments. With a focus on troubleshooting, automation, and scalability, this class goes beyond theory to ensure you're fully equipped to manage containerized workloads in cloud, hybrid, and on-premises deployments.

Taught by experienced AWS expert and trainer Rick Crisci, this course provides in-depth, step-by-step instruction alongside hands-on labs, making it ideal for developers, DevOps engineers, and IT professionals looking to master AWS container services. Whether you're building cloud-native applications or migrating existing workloads to AWS, this course offers essential skills and best practices to streamline your container deployment and management strategy.
